# Pokémon Team Builder - CFG Group Project (June 2023)

[Pokemon Top Trumps](https://replit.com/@SweetNighthawk/CFG-Project-Test-Code)


## Overview
This project was created as part of the Code First Girls (CFG) group project in June 2023.
This is a Replit application written in Python which allows users to choose and battle Pokémon based on character stats. 
Pokémon cards are assigned at random from the API and the program compares the STAT values. If the same card is drawn, it’s changed for another. If the user STAT is higher than computer, user scores and wins and vice versa. If STATs are equal, game draws and scores stay the same.

In our game, the STATs available to the user include: name, id, height, weight, base experience.
